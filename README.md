# PyBer_Analysis
module  5

Overview
This assignment was to show the differences between rural, suburban and urban cities. 

Results 
as you can see on the Charts  Pybers services were the most consistent in Urban areas requiring more drivers. the Average fare was less compared to the other 2 areas however you can see that the total fares is almost twice the amount of both rural and suburban areas put together. 

Summary 
To conclude there is lots of opportunity for the CEO to develop its company within the Rural and Suburban areas, hiring more drivers should drive more use of the services while driving up more revenue for the company. Another suggestion is to test out lower fare rides in Rural areas the Average fare in rural area is 34.62 compared to urban areas 24.53, if fares for rides are lowed you can hope to see a drastic increase in use of serverices. especially when rural area only makes up just slightly more then 6% of fares. There is clearly alot of room for development in the rural areas
